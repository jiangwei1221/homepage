        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a second-year Master's student in the Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta. I am working with Dr. Davood Rafiei in the Database Systems Group. Before coming to Canada, I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in China.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am highly interested in text analytics and Web mining. My research topic is geo-tagging named entities in diverse Web pages. Previously I worked on relation extraction in text content using co-clustering techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides working towards the degree, I spend time in building apps and tools, solving algorithmic problems/puzzles, and playing chess.         
        </p>
